# NgryChat - hackathon app

This project was upgraded to [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

Upgrade path taken for Angular CLI from 1.7.0 --> 7.1.4 was followed using this [version commit diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff/compare/1.7.0...7.1.4).

Upgrade path taken for Angular 5.2 --> 7.1 was followed using the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/).

Ran the following command `npx rxjs-tslint rxjs-5-to-6-migrate -p src/tsconfig.app.json` for the Angular CLI to update the RxJs syntax from 5 to 6.
